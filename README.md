# Quick-Sort
Quick Sort is another example of a divide and conquer algorithm. It requires the identification of an arbitrary pivot point (ideally somewhere near the centre) around which the other values of the array are ordered relatively. This pivot creates a partition in the array. To the left of the pivot we aim to place the values lower than it and to the right the higher values.
